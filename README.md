# # Kultra Mega Stores – SQL Analysis (DSA Capstone Project)

This repository contains my SQL-based capstone project as part of the Data Science and Analytics (DSA) program with Incubator Hub.

## 📊 Project Overview

Kultra Mega Stores is a retail company dealing in office supplies and furniture. This analysis focuses on their order and sales data from 2009 to 2012.

Using SQL, I explored key business metrics such as:
- Top and bottom regions by sales
- Best-selling product categories
- High-value and low-value customers
- Shipping costs across delivery methods
- Return patterns and customer segmentation

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- SQL (SQLite / MySQL / PostgreSQL)
- Excel (for data viewing and light formatting)
- GitHub (for version control and portfolio presentation)

## 📌 Key Insights

- 📍 The **West** region recorded the highest sales.
- 📉 **Appliances** underperformed in certain regions.
- 🚚 **Express Air** had the highest shipping cost, often used for low-priority orders (inefficient).
- 🧍‍♂️ Some high-return customers were from the **Consumer** segment.
